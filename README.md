# Brew & Bloom Coffee Website

This repository contains a modern, glassmorphism-driven coffee shop website with a full JavaScript animation system, a particle background, a custom cursor, and a dark mode toggle. The design uses Tailwind CSS via CDN and showcases a Shop page in addition to Home, About, and Contact pages.

How to run:
- Open index.html in a browser to view the Home page.
- Use the Shop, About, and Contact pages via the navigation.
- All pages include a loading screen on the home page, glassmorphism UI, a parallax-like hero feel, and interactive elements.

Tech notes:
- Tailwind CSS: loaded via CDN
- Design system: coffee-inspired color palette
- Glass components: nav, cards, and CTAs
- Particle background: canvas-based implementation
- Custom cursor: dot + outline with hover interactions
- Dark mode: toggle with persistence
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, skip link
